OpenSMOKE++ Solvers Project!
=====================

The OpenSMOKE++ Solvers Project is a collection of numerical solvers built on the top of the OpenSMOKE++ framework.
The project is managed by the [CRECK Modeling Group][1] at the Department of Chemistry, Materials, and 
Chemical Engineering of the Politecnico di Milano (Italy).
